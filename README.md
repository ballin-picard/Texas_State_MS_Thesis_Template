# Texas State University - MS Thesis LaTeX Template

GitHub Repository to share and cloud store LaTeX code for my MS Thesis for the Department of Physics at Texas State University. I graduated with my MS in Physics in May, 2022 and now work at Intel. - M. Ford

This GitHub is updated periodically as changes are required. User feedback is welcome, as this is not meant to be an absolute stick-to-it template - things can be improved and changed. Feedback is the best way to identify and solve bugs and issues.
